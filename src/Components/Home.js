                <p id="intro-p">Web design integrates art and creativity with logic. I fell in love with web development and plan to continue my journey learning as much as I can. I like to keep things as simple as possible without sacrificing beauty along the way. While my coding journey has been self taught, I have extensive experience in customer service, leadership roles, and running a small-business with my partner. My love of learning, passion for excellence and problem solving, plus a weird bout of homeschooling that was equally self-taught...has created an individual that brings their all to their work. Check out my projects below!
